                    In the 1980s, large areas of forest were replaced by pastures in the Amazon. At that time, the
                    rubber tappers' movement in Acre was joining forces to block devastation and guarantee the right of
                    possession of their settlements. Moved by the resistance of the forest's guardians, on September 30,
                    1988, in the city of Rio Branco, State of Acre, teachers, university students and representatives of
                    the social movement, including the activist and rubber tapper Chico Mendes, created the SOS Amazônia
                    Association, having as main objective to defend the extractivists' cause and to protect the Amazon
                    Rainforest, supporting traditional populations. <br><br>

                    In a scenario of conflicts over land occupation, the institution dedicated itself to publicly
                    exposing data and photos about deforestation in the region, making complaints about the threats
                    suffered by rubber tappers, distributing informative materials and talking to people about the
                    theme, aiming to mobilize society and facilitate their understanding of the causes and consequences
                    of the destruction that was taking place at the time. <br><br>

                    In view of the delicate moment that extractivists lived, in addition to awareness campaigns, there
                    was a felt need for the institution to develop projects, propose and implement public policies with
                    a focus models and practices for biodiversity preservation and sustainable development, initiatives
                    that guide, on a daily basis, the duty to fulfill SOS Amazônia's mission, which is "to promote the
                    conservation of biodiversity and the growth of environmental awareness in the Amazon."
